# Title: YouTube Churn Price Risk Assessment

_This project transitions from descriptive churn analysis to a forward-looking price risk simulation framework.
Rather than forecasting fixed churn values, the objective is to model potential inflection conditions under hypothetical price adjustment scenarios by integrating macroeconomic signals, behavioral segmentation, and market sentiment._

## 1. Research : Scenario-Based Price Risk Assessment Framework

- This project transitions from descriptive churn analysis to a forward-looking price risk simulation framework.
- Rather than forecasting fixed churn values, the objective is to model potential inflection conditions under hypothetical price adjustment scenarios by integrating macroeconomic signals, behavioral segmentation, and market sentiment.

** Macro-Economic Sensitivity (The “Golden Cross” Signal) ✔️ Validated** 

- Research: Customer churn risk is not solely a function of price, but may intensify when CPI (Consumer Price Index) growth outpaces the relative growth of service costs—indicating pressure on real disposable income
- Objective: To identify structural inflection conditions where macroeconomic pressure could amplify price sensitivity, serving as a key external risk input for the simulator

** Behavioral Resilience of Controversy Survivors ❓ Processing**

- Research: Customer segments that remained active during the Q3 2025 Family Plan policy shift may demonstrate structurally different sensitivity patterns compared to newer or single-user segments
- Objective: To assign differentiated resilience weights to long-term or family-plan users (Partner/Dependents), enabling segment-adjusted churn probability simulations

** Utility Trade-off: Ad Aversion vs. Substitution Threat**

- Research: Churn behavior may reflect a shifting balance between the perceived utility of an ad-free experience and the opportunity cost of switching to alternative services
- Objective: By analyzing the relative search intensity of **Alternatives** versus **Ad-Free benefits** the simulator estimates potential tipping conditions where switching intent becomes more pronounced
